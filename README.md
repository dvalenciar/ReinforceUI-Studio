ReinforceUI Studio is a Python-based application designed to simplify the configuration and monitoring of Reinforcement Learning (RL) training processes. Featuring an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), it eliminates the hassle of managing extra repositories or memorizing complex command lines.

Everything you need to train your RL model is provided in one repository. With just a few clicks, you can train your model, visualize the training process, and save the model for later use—ready to be deployed and analyzed.


Please check out our **full documentation** available [here](https://docs.reinforceui-studio.com) for installation instructions, tutorials, RL concepts, and more.

# Supported Algorithms
ReinforceUI Studio supports the following algorithms:

| Algorithm | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CTD4 | Continuous Distributional Actor-Critic Agent with a Kalman Fusion of Multiple Critics |
| DDPG | Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient |
| DQN | Deep Q-Network |
| PPO | Proximal Policy Optimization |
| SAC | Soft Actor-Critic |
| TD3 | Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient |
| TQC | Controlling Overestimation Bias with Truncated Mixture of Continuous Distributional Quantile Critics |


# Why you should use ReinforceUI Studio
1. Simplified RL Workflows: The intuitive GUI eliminates the need for complex command-line operations
2. Environment Support: Seamlessly integrates with MuJoCo, OpenAI Gymnasium, and DeepMind Control Suite.
3. Algorithm Customization: Adjust hyperparameters and algorithms or use optimized defaults for quick experiments.
4. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard: View training progress, metrics, and performance curves as they happen.
5. Comprehensive Data Logging: Automatically capture training data, evaluation results, plots, models, and videos for easy post-training analysis.
6. User-Friendly Training and Testing: Train, evaluate, and refine RL policies through a streamlined and intuitive workflow.
